DUAW is the go-to platform for TechLabs teams and graduate students to showcase graduation projects. This project hub documents and presents all TechLabs graduation projects and the people behind them, through the years and from across the world. On highly visualized and detailed project pages, graduate students can upload their projects for others to learn about them, upvote their projects, contact them with requests for collaborations, questions, recommendations or feedback. DUAW aims to strengthen the TechLabs alumni community and support TechLabs to reach more students and partners, while offering graduate projects the visibility and opportunities they deserve.
